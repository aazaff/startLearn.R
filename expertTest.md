# Introduction

The following are a set of self-test questions designed to complement the expertConcepts tutorial. These exercises are only meant to be attempted after you have finished the expertConcepts tutorial.

## Problem Set

Load in the ````precip```` dataset. 

1. What is the **mean**, **median**, and **standard deviation** of ````precip````?

2. Is ````precip```` best visualized using a ````barplot( )```` or ````hist( )````? Why?

3. Generate a vector of random numbers drawn from a normal distribution with the same mean, standard deviation, and number of elements as in the ````precip```` dataset. Name this vector ````RandomNormal````.

4. Write a function that tests, based on the means of each distribution, whether it is likely that ````RandomNormal```` and ````precip```` were drawn from the same underlying distribution.

5. Create a ````density( )```` plot of ````precip```` and ````RandomNormal````. Is the test your performed above a good or bad indicator of whether the two distributions are identical? Why or why not?
